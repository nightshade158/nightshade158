## Hi there 👋 I'm Collin

🎯 A passionate **Computer Science enthusiast** exploring the vastness of tech — from silicon to software.

### 👨‍💻 About Me

- 🔭 Currently building cool stuff in **AI**, **Android (Kotlin / React Native / Java)**, and **WebApps** using **MERN**, **Flask**, and more.
- 🧠 Always learning something new — whether it's **Rust**, **Operating System internals**, or **low-level programming** with **Assembly**.
- 💻 Built my own **custom OS** using Assembly and tools like **QEMU** (yes, I do sleep... sometimes).
- 🧰 Skilled in:
  - Languages: `C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `Rust`, `Kotlin`, `JavaScript`, `Assembly`
  - Tools & Frameworks: `Node.js`, `Express`, `MongoDB`, `React`, `Flask`, `Android SDK`, `Jetpack Compose`
  - Systems: `Ubuntu`, `Kali Linux`, `Arch Linux`, `Windows`, `Android (including NetHunter & Arch-based mobile distros)`
- 🧪 Tinkerer of OS architectures, reverse engineering, and hardware-level experimentation.

### ⚡ Fun Tech Highlights

- 🧬 AI geek dabbling in computer vision, transformers, and prompt engineering.
- 📱 Android apps + 🖥️ WebApps = 🔁 Cross-platform fun!
- 🔐 Occasionally break things for fun — responsibly, of course 😉 (CTF anyone?)
- 🔧 Love tweaking systems till they purr like a custom-tuned engine.
